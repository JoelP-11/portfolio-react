# portfolio-react

This react application is my portfolio, the main highlights being an About me section which provides the viewer with information regarding me, the portfolio tab which shows 5 projects with a hover effect and description giving quick information about each project along with screenshots of each project which take up each box, a Contact me tab where viewers can enter their name and email to contact me and lastly a resume tab which includes technical hard skills relating to both front and back end. The link at the top of this tab also leads the viewer to my LinkedIn profile, This Portfolio works well on small and large screens. It is missing a footer which is something I will work on adding in the future, for the future I would also like to implement more Icons. Below I have my deployed Portfolio linked.
